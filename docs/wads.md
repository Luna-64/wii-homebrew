## Installation

1. Download YAWM ModMii edition from [here](https://oscwii.org/library/app/yawmME) and extract it to your SD card. Alternatively, you could download it from LibreShop or OSC-DL.
2. Create a folder named `wad` on the root of your SD card and place your downloaded WADs there.
3. Open YAWMME in the homebrew channel.
4. Select the source device which contains your WAD files.
5. Navigate to the folder which contains your WADs. If you have a folder called `wad`, it will open automatically.
6. Navigate to the WAD you would like to install and press A. If you would like to install multiple WAD files at the same time, hover over them and press +, then press A once they are all selected.
7. Press A again to install the WADs.
8. Press any button to continue, then press the home button to return back to the homebrew channel.

- If you would like to uninstall a WAD repeat the steps above, but select `Uninstall WAD` instead on step 7.
