# Syscheck

## What is a Syscheck?
A syscheck is a useful tool for people who help with Wii Homebrew as it allows them to view all your IOS and cIOS.

## Usage
1. Download Syscheck ModMii Editon from [here](https://hbb1.oscwii.org/api/v3/contents/SysCheckME/SysCheckME.zip) and extract it to your SD Card. Alternatively, you could download it from LibreShop or OSC-DL.
2. Go to the homebrew channel and launch Syscheck ModMii Edition.
3. Wait for it to load, then press A to run the Syscheck.
4. Once it has finished, you can press A to display the report.
5. Press the home button to exit.
6. On the root of your SD card, a file will be created called `syscheck.csv`. Send this file to the person who told you to run the syscheck.
