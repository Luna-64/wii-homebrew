# BootMii

!> Backing up your nand is very important. While it is optional, it is highly recommended.

The primary function of BootMii is to create a backup of your Wii system's NAND. Having a NAND backup is essential for repairing a bricked Wii console. This guide will provide instructions on how to perform a backup of the Wii's NAND, ensuring you have a safeguard in case of any issues or failures.

## What do I need?

- A SD card with at least a single gigabyte of free space
- A Computer
- A Homebrewed Wii

?> If you installed BootMii as boot2 restart the console and skip steps 1 and 2.

1. Launch the Homebrew Channel
2. Press the `home` button and select `Launch BootMii`

## Backing up the NAND

?> Please note that navigating the BootMii menus cannot be done using a Wii remote. Instead, you will need to use either the `power` and `reset` buttons on the Wii console itself or a GameCube controller to navigate through the BootMii menu options.

3. From the BootMii menu, select the icon that resembles gears.
4. Within the gears menu, locate and select the icon for BackUpMii.
    - The process of backing up the NAND will commence.
    - Please note that encountering `bad blocks` during this process is normal.
5. Once the backup is complete, you can exit by pressing any button.
6. To exit BootMii, press the back button.
7. It is important to store the NAND Backup in a safe and secure location on your computer for future reference and potential restoration purposes.
