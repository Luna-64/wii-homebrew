## Modded Wii Uses
- Patch your disks to play ROM Hacks of games you own
- Play backups of games you own on your console from a USB drive or SD card without the need for the disc
- [For more information, check out Wii: Things to do over at wiki.hacks.guide](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Wii:Things_to_do)
## What do I need to know before starting?
!> Every time you modify a device, you always have a chance to have a **UNRECOVERABLE BRICK!**, The chances of being bricked are close to none nowadays, but they are still a possibility! So make sure you follow **ALL** directions **EXACTLY**.

?> This guide will work on any Wii on 4.3 or below, you just need an SD card, a device to put files onto the SD card, and a Wii with access to the internet.

If everything goes well, you should have everything you started with (WiiWare, saves, etc.)

Keep your console plugged in at all times to prevent data loss & damage.
